# SeenFiles (DEMO)
My first soft for easy using computer and folders.

For use this program need:
1) Download files from repository convenient way for you (Files or archive - SeenFiles.zip);
2) Open application with .exe (SeenFiles.exe), and wait when will appear text "Select name of directory: ";
3) After that you should input full path to folder which you want scanning, for example: (D:\Python\myprogram) - in this format;
4) Now you need waiting until the program closes.

After all you have a folder with .txt files in which be name of file which program found and his contents.
The point of this program is sorting file for expansions and simplify file handling.


Below is Python file (SeenFiles.py) for developers which want improve my program.
