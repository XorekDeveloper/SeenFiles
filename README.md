# SeenFiles (DEMO)
My first soft for easy using computer and folders.

For use this program need:
1) Download files from repository;
2) Open application with .exe and wait when will appear text "Select name of directory: ";
3) After that you should input full path to folder which you want scanning;
4) Now you need waiting until the program closes.

After all you have a folder with .txt files in which be name of file which program found and his contents.
The point of this program is sorting file for expansions and simplify file handling.
